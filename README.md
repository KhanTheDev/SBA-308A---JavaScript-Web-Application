# Weather App

This is a simple weather app I made for my JavaScript class. It lets you check the weather in different cities.

## What it does:
- Search for weather by city name
- Shows temperature, weather description, and humidity
- Keeps track of your recent searches
- Click on history items to search again

## How to use:
1. Type a city name in the search box
2. Click "Search" or press Enter
3. See the weather info appear below
4. Your searches are saved in the history section

## Files:
- `index.html` - the main page
- `styles.css` - makes it look nice
- `app.js` - main app code
- `weather.js` - gets weather data from API
- `history.js` - saves and loads search history

## Note:
You need to get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap and put it in the weather.js file to make it work.

## What I learned:
- How to use fetch API
- Working with async/await
- JavaScript modules
- Local storage
- Event handling
